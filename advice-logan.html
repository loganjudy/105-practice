	<h4>Confusion can be productive</h4>
		<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before.  It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific it's never been done before.  Confusion, then, is an opportunity to iron out details you didn't know before, and engage in active problem-solving skills.</p>
	<h4>Suspend your disbelief</h4>
		<p>Sometimes you will write code that works, but you won't understand for the life of you WHY it works.  That's okay.  Just go with the flow, read the code, and pick up everything that you can.  Some of it will make more sense as you work with it more.</p>
